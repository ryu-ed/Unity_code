# Walk program (Unity)
Scripts in c # for the execution of walk, still and attack animations of a zombie. So also a script that controls the patrol pattern of my character.

Script Enemy01.cs: script that controls the action of the character's animations.
Script Interpolar.cs: script that controls the patrols of the character. That is, it tells you where to stand if I am not in your attack radius.
